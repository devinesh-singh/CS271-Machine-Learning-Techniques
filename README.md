Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
- implement a HMM using pseudocode from Textbook (Introduction to Machine Learning with Applications in Information Security by Mark Stamp)

Classification and Dimension Reduction:
- Problem 11 and 13: principal component analysis
- Problem 17: support vector machine

Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Benign and Malware Datasets: 40 samples of each
- Problem 10: train and test a SVM on the benign and malware sample datasets using the kernel function.
- Problem 11: train and test a SVM on the benign and malware sample datasets using the gaussian radial basis (RBF) function.
- Problem 12: train and test a SVM on the HMM, SSD, and OGS scores dataset to determine the accuracy. Additionally, perform a RFE reduction on the data and list the SVM weights and accuracy.
